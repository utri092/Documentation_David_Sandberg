#This repository contains my experience of using it

#If you have the computing power feel free to make your own model or use a pre-trained one over a huge dataset


#Credits go to Mr Nathan Bond who streamlined the process of learning for me. I am extremely grateful to him for his time
Here is a an article made by him which will make it easy for users.

#Observations:
1)It correctly identifies images even if test images are placed in the wrong folder.
2)It's accuracy increases if trained over more images of a single person.
3)If a set of white images or unrelated images are put, there is still detection but accuracy is very low. This proves that there must be a minimum threshold.
4)Actual math algorithms are executed in high performing C++. Will learn about them in the next few weeks.
5)Excited to see how python creates a flow for the math to be executed.
